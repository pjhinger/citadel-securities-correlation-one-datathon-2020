# Citadel Securities Correlation One Summer Invitational Data Open 2020

This is my team's submission for the Summer Invitational this year. I was selected as one of the top 200 out of 2000 applicants to participate in this datathon this year. I led the investigation on the socioeconomic impact brought to the UK as a result of the London 2012 Olympics. I, in particular, conducted an EDA and then a hypothesis test to test for a difference in the means of the population of ethnic minorities employed before 2012 and after 2012 and evaluated if this was a result of the attractiveness of London due to Olympic campaigning.
